Continue implementation of the DrChrono PHP SDK Complete API Coverage roadmap.

**North Star Goal:** Create the perfect PHP SDK for the DrChrono API that can be dropped into any project and give developers full access to the DrChrono systems - production-grade quality that DrChrono would be proud to officially release.

**Context:**
- Roadmap: `ROADMAP.md`
- Current coverage audit: `docs/API_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md`
- Implementation guide: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- Current status: Check `docs/PROGRESS.md` for latest progress

**Your Task:**
1. **Review Progress:** Read `docs/PROGRESS.md` to understand what's been completed
2. **Continue Implementation:** Pick up where the last developer left off, following the roadmap phases
3. **Record Progress:** Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` with:
   - What you completed (with file paths and line references)
   - What you tested and verified
   - Any roadmap adjustments needed (with justification)
   - Blockers or questions discovered
   - What's next for the next developer
4. **Maintain Quality:**
   - Follow patterns in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Write tests for everything (90%+ coverage target)
   - Update documentation as you go
   - Commit frequently with clear messages
5. **Adjust as Needed:**
   - If you discover the roadmap needs changes, document WHY and update it
   - If API documentation differs from our plan, adjust and note it
   - Always keep the North Star in mind - "would DrChrono be proud of this?"

**Quality Checklist (before you finish):**
- [ ] All new code has PHPDoc comments
- [ ] All new resources have unit tests
- [ ] All new features have usage examples
- [ ] README updated if adding new resources
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with changes
- [ ] `docs/PROGRESS.md` updated with detailed progress
- [ ] Code follows PSR-12 and passes PHPStan level 8
- [ ] All changes committed with clear messages
- [ ] Branch pushed to remote

**When You're Done:**
Leave clear notes in `docs/PROGRESS.md` about:
1. What you accomplished
2. What still needs work
3. Any issues or questions for the next developer
4. Recommended next steps

**Remember:** This is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on quality over speed. Each piece should be production-ready before moving on.
